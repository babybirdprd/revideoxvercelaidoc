Completed:
- Created enhanced plan.txt outlining comprehensive integration of Vercel AI SDK
- Created the API endpoint `app/api/ai/route.ts` to handle AI requests
- Created the AIVideoEditor component in `app/components/AIVideoEditor.tsx`
- Created the API endpoint `app/api/scene-data/route.ts` to fetch scene data
- Created the API endpoint `app/api/apply-code/route.ts` to apply generated code
- Updated the AIVideoEditor component to fetch scene data from the API
- Implemented dark mode support with next-themes
- Set up project management system with Zustand
- Enhanced AI integration with improved prompts and operation types
- Added code validation and backup support for scene modifications
- Implemented ProjectList component for managing multiple videos
- Added structured data generation for templates
- Implemented tool calls for validation and style application
- Added real-time UI updates for tool execution status
- Enhanced error handling with validation status display
- Added template system with apply-template endpoint
- Improved scene data extraction and structure

In progress:
- Implementing template storage system
- Adding more AI tools for advanced operations
- Enhancing style transfer capabilities

Next steps:
1. Implement history tracking for scene changes
2. Add undo/redo functionality
3. Add performance optimizations for rendering
4. Implement keyboard shortcuts
5. Add automated testing
6. Add template gallery UI
7. Implement template management system

Dependencies added:
- next-themes (dark mode)
- zustand (state management)
- @headlessui/react (UI components)
- @heroicons/react (icons)
- @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree (code validation)
- @ai-sdk/openai (OpenAI integration)
- @ai-sdk/react (AI SDK React components)
- ai (Vercel AI SDK core)

Notes:
- Use pnpm add for package management
- Ensure all new components follow dark mode theming
- Implement proper error handling for AI operations
- Consider adding rate limiting for AI operations
- Add loading states for better UX
- Consider implementing caching for common AI operations
- Use structured data generation for complex operations
- Leverage tool calls for better AI control
